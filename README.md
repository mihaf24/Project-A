# Job Platform Website (Clique)

This is a personal project where i wanted to make a platform for employer and employee where an employer can find skilled employee to
get their job done and on the other hand and employee can find a job easily. 

In this project an Employee can make their personal profile and protfolio showcasing their skills & everything. Any employee can hire or 
contact with the employee to make use of their skills. 

I have used Procedural PHP in this project. There might be some bugs but feel free to debug any problem. <3
